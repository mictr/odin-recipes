    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The Chinese term for this braised pork belly recipe (hóngshāo ròu –
      红烧肉), literally means “red cooked pork.” Red cooking describes a
      braising technique using soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, and rice wine
      to creates a rich, reddish, dark-brown sauce.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 pounds lean, skin-on pork belly</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons rock sugar</li>
      <li>1/3 cup Shaoxing wine</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>3 cups water</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil.</li>
      <li>
        Blanch the pork for a couple minutes. This gets rid of the impurities
        and starts the cooking process.
      </li>
      <li>Take the pork out of the pot, and set it aside.</li>
      <li>Discard the water in the wok and clean it out.</li>
      <li>
        Over low heat, add oil and sugar to your wok. Melt the sugar slightly
        and add the pork.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn the heat back down to low and add Shaoxing wine, regular soy sauce,
        dark soy sauce, and water. It's very important to the color and flavor
        of this dish that you have both kinds of soy sauce!
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until
        pork is fork tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it
        gets too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid,
        uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce
        has reduced to a glistening coating.
      </li>
    </ol>
