      <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon ground mustard</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 tablespoon vegetable oil, for cooking</li>
      <li>Heaping 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>4 slices of Cheddar cheese</li>

      <li>
        In a large bowl, combine the beef, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder,
        ground mustard, and Worcestershire sauce. (Do not put the salt in the
        mixture; you'll add it later.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Using your hands, mix until evenly combined. Form the meat into 4 large
        meatballs (about 4 1/2 oz each).
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat each ball into a 1-inch thick disc; smooth out the edges as best you
        can.
      </li>
      <li>
        Refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until ready to coook (up to 24
        hours, covered).
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn on your exhaust fan and heat a 12-inch cast-iron or nonstick
        skillet over medium-high heat.

      <li>Remove the patties from the fridge and season all over with salt.</li>
      <li>Coat the hot pan evenly with oil.</li>
      <li>
        Place the burgers on the skillet one at a time, firmly smashing the next
        one.

        Let cook for about 2 minutes until nicely browned and crusty on the
        bottom.
      </li>
      <li>
        Flip the burgers and top with cheese; cook for about 2 minutes more for
        medium-rare to medium burgers, or 3 minutes for medium to medium-well
        burgers.
